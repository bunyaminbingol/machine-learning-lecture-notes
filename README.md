# machine-learning-lecture-notes

I am sharing with you the notes I took when I first started machine learning (2019).

> This study was created by using the "Machine Learning with Python" course of Sadi Evren Åžeker. https://www.udemy.com/course/makine-ogrenmesi/

> I also share the Turkish notes I took during the course as a pdf.
